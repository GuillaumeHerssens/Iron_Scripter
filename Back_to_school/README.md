# PowerShell Back-to-School Scripting Challenge

For many people, it is back-to-school time. This time of years always makes The Chairman nostalgic, so he has commissioned a new set of PowerShell scripting challenges. 
These tasks are aimed at beginner level PowerShell scripters, with a few bonuses targeted toward intermediate users. Although everyone is welcome and encouraged to try their hand.

----
### The Challenges

You need to create simple PowerShell functions to meet the following goals. Each task should result in a separate function.

	- Given 2 lengths of a right triangle, calculate the missing length. 
	  You will need to let the user specify which sides (traditionally A,B and C) of the triangle they are specifying.
	- Calculate the area of a circle with a given diameter.
	- Calculate the volume of a sphere with a given diameter.
	- Calculate the volume of a cylinder from a given diameter and height.
	- Calculate the factorial of an integer.

### Intermediate Additions

For those of you with a bit more PowerShell experience, your functions should include parameter validation and error handling. Your function should have an option to write a rich object to the pipeline. 
For example, the first challenge might have you write an object with properties of A, B, and C. Finally, you should be able to create a simple module with a manifest.
